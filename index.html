            <h3>About Myself</h3>
            <p>Hello, my name is Gilles, and I am a 18-year-old computer science student from Antwerp. Ever since I
                was a child, I have been fascinated by technology and its ability to shape the world around us. As I
                grew older, my passion for technology only continued to grow, and I knew that I wanted to pursue a
                career in the field of computer science.
                <br>
                What I love most about computer science is its ability to solve complex problems and create innovative
                solutions. I am constantly exploring new technologies and programming tools to develop my skills and
                broaden my knowledge in this field. I am always excited to learn new things and take on new challenges.
                <br>
                Aside from my academic interests, I enjoy spending my free time playing video games and exploring new
                technology. I am passionate about the potential of technology to make a positive impact on the world,
                and I am eager to continue learning and growing in this field.</p>
